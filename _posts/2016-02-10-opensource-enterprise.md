title: Open Source Enterprise Rant...
---

I've recently been trying to use open source software to set up some enterprise business stuff.
I'm kind of upset with the quality of the open source software and the documentation.
Things just don't work the way you would expect them to!

Anyways, I've been pretty busy with life so I haven't posted recently.
I hope to be writing more soon!
